## Core Principles

- Always implement code using established best practices with security in mind.
- Prefer clarity, maintainability, and correctness over shortcuts or quick fixes.
- Follow idiomatic patterns and conventions of the language and framework used.
- Maintain consistency across the codebase.

## Research and Context

- Use Context7 MCP to verify best practices, check newer library versions, or resolve uncertainty.
- Do not rely on assumptions when documentation or best practices can be confirmed.

## Clarification Policy

- If requirements or intent are unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- Think through decisions before implementation.

## Pull Request Reviews

- Use available tools to orchestrate reviews across the entire codebase.
- Evaluate changes against framework conventions, architecture consistency, security, and best practices.
- Provide clear, actionable feedback with professional engineering standards.

## Architecture and Decision Making

- Think long term for maintainability and future contributors.
- Favor clean architecture and sustainable design over short-term solutions.
- Highlight potential efficiency improvements when relevant.
- Mention cleaner refactors when they add clear value.

## Implementation Approach

- Analyze surrounding context before making changes.
- Understand project scope before selecting solutions.
- Ensure changes align with existing architecture and coding patterns.
